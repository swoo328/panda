        <p>Giant pandas have a distinctive appearance. Their thick black and white fur equips them for life in cool forests. Their white coat with black markings is unique, with black patches round the eyes and ears, black legs, and a black band around the shoulders. And they have cute white tails.

            They Have "Cat-Like" Pupils
            They have good geographical memory, hearing, and sense of smell, but their sight is poor. However, they have cat-like pupils, so they can still see adequately to move around at night.
            
            Giant Pandas Have Strong Teeth
            Giant pandas start to grow permanent teeth as they gradually draw to 7 months old. Their back teeth are about seven times the size of a human's, with a wide surface area. The powerful jaw bones and strong teeth of giant pandas help them crush and grind bamboo.
            
            Their Paws Have Six "Fingers"!
            Giant pandas' paws have five "fingers" facing forward and one "thumb" â€” an enlarged bone at the heel of the paw used for gripping bamboo, climbing trees, etc.</p>
